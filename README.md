## iNFT
The term iNFT is an abbreviation for intelligent Non-Fungible Token. In essence, an iNFT brings to life the underlying unique digital item of its NFT by using the generative powers of artificial intelligence.

As a simple analogy equates iNFTs to Humans with three parts:

* Body (ERC 721 that shows the image/PFP) 
* Soul (A Pod with Different Intelligence Levels) 
* Mind (As the Soul Matures in Intelligence Levels, the Mind is capable of Performing higher-order services that can be offered on the AI Protocol)

Any NFT can be turned into an iNFT via the iNFT Protocol. This is achieved by fusing the NFT with another ERC-721 asset called the Personality Pod. Once the NFT is fused with a Personality Pod, it acquires its own unique AI-powered personality.
